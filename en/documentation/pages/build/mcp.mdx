Connect external tools from [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to your Dify apps. Instead of just built-in tools, you can use tools from the growing [MCP ecosystem](https://mcpservers.org/).

<Note>
  This covers using MCP tools in Dify. To publish Dify apps as MCP servers, see [here](/en/documentation/pages/publish/publish-mcp).
</Note>

<Info>
  Only supports MCP servers with [HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#transport-layer) right now.

## Adding MCP servers

Go to **Tools** → **MCP** in your workspace.

Click **Add MCP Server (HTTP)**:

**Server URL**: Where the MCP server lives (like `https://api.notion.com/mcp`)

**Name & Icon**: Call it something useful. Dify tries to grab icons automatically.

**Server ID**: Unique identifier (lowercase, numbers, underscores, hyphens, max 24 chars)

<Warning>
  Never change the server ID once you start using it. This will break any apps that use tools from this server.
</Warning>

## What happens next

Dify automatically:
1. Connects to the server
2. Handles any OAuth stuff
3. Gets the list of available tools
4. Makes them available in your app builder

You'll see a server card once it finds tools:

## Managing servers

Click any server card to:

**Update Tools**: Refresh when the external service adds new tools

**Re-authorize**: Fix auth when tokens expire

**Edit Settings**: Change server details (but not the ID!)

**Remove**: Disconnect the server (this breaks apps using its tools)

## Using MCP tools

Once connected, MCP tools show up everywhere you'd expect:

**In agents**: Tools appear grouped by server ("Notion MCP » Create Page")

**In workflows**: MCP tools become available as nodes

**In agent nodes**: Same as regular agents

## Customizing tools

When you add an MCP tool, you can customize it:

**Description**: Override the default description to be more specific

**Parameters**: For each tool parameter, choose:
- **Auto**: Let the AI decide the value
- **Fixed**: Set a specific value that never changes

**Example**: For a search tool, set `numResults` to 5 (fixed) but keep `query` on auto.

## Sharing apps

When you export apps that use MCP tools:
- The export includes server IDs
- To use the app elsewhere, add the same servers with identical IDs
- Document which MCP servers your app needs

## Troubleshooting

**"Unconfigured Server"**: Check the URL and re-authorize

**Missing tools**: Hit "Update Tools"

**Broken apps**: You probably changed a server ID. Add it back with the original ID.

## Tips

- Use permanent, descriptive server IDs like `github-prod` or `crm-system`
- Keep the same MCP setup across dev/staging/production
- Set fixed values for config stuff, auto for dynamic inputs
- Test MCP integrations before deploying
