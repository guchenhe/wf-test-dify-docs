Follow these best practices to build robust, maintainable workflows in Dify.

## Design Principles

### Keep It Simple
Start with the simplest workflow that solves your problem. Add complexity only when necessary.

### Modular Design
Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable sub-workflows or use iteration nodes for repeated logic.

### Error Handling
Always implement error handling for external API calls and user inputs.

## Performance Tips

<Tip>
  - Minimize API calls by caching results
  - Use conditional nodes to skip unnecessary processing
  - Parallelize independent operations
</Tip>

## Testing Strategy

Test workflows thoroughly:
1. Test with edge cases
2. Validate error scenarios
3. Check performance with realistic data volumes

## Documentation

Document your workflow:
- Add node descriptions
- Use clear variable names
- Include inline comments for complex logic
