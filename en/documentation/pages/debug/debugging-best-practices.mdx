Effective debugging strategies help you identify and resolve issues quickly in your Dify workflows.

## General Debugging Strategies

### Start Simple
Begin debugging with the simplest possible workflow configuration. Add complexity gradually to isolate issues.

### Use Step-by-Step Execution
Leverage the step-run feature to execute nodes one at a time and observe intermediate results.

<Tip>
  Enable step-run mode from the debug toolbar to pause execution between nodes.
</Tip>

## Common Debugging Patterns

### 1. Variable Inspection
Always inspect variable values at each step to ensure data flows correctly.

```
Input → Process → Output
  ↓       ↓         ↓
Check   Check     Check
```

### 2. Error Handling
Implement proper error handling at critical nodes:

- Add fallback values
- Use conditional logic
- Set up error notifications

### 3. Logging Strategy
Add strategic log nodes throughout your workflow to track execution paths.

## Performance Debugging

### Identify Bottlenecks
- Check node execution times in the logs
- Look for timeout warnings
- Monitor API call latencies

### Optimize Slow Nodes
- Reduce data payload sizes
- Use caching where appropriate
- Parallelize independent operations

## Testing in Production

<Warning>
  Always test changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.
</Warning>

### Safe Testing Practices
1. Create a duplicate workflow for testing
2. Use test data that mirrors production
3. Monitor error rates after deployment
4. Keep rollback plans ready
