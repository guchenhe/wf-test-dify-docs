Dify provides a comprehensive suite of debugging tools to help you build reliable workflows.

## Built-in Debug Tools

### Debug Console
The debug console displays real-time execution information:
- Node execution status
- Variable values
- Error messages
- Performance metrics

### Breakpoints
Set breakpoints on specific nodes to pause execution:

1. Click on a node
2. Enable the breakpoint toggle
3. Run the workflow
4. Execution pauses at the breakpoint

<Info>
  Breakpoints are only active during debug sessions and don't affect production runs.
</Info>

## Variable Inspector

### Inspecting Complex Data
The variable inspector supports:
- **Nested objects**: Expand and collapse object properties
- **Arrays**: View array contents with indices
- **Large strings**: Truncated display with full-text viewer
- **JSON formatting**: Syntax-highlighted JSON view

### Variable Watch
Add variables to your watch list to track their values across multiple runs:

```
Watch List:
├─ user_input (string)
├─ api_response (object)
└─ processing_result (array)
```

## Network Inspector

### API Call Monitoring
Monitor all API calls made by your workflow:
- Request URLs and headers
- Request/response payloads
- Response times
- Status codes

### Debugging API Issues
Common API debugging scenarios:
- **Timeout errors**: Check network latency
- **401/403 errors**: Verify authentication credentials
- **Rate limiting**: Monitor request frequency

## Performance Profiler

### Execution Timeline
Visualize your workflow execution timeline to identify:
- Long-running nodes
- Sequential vs. parallel execution
- Waiting time between nodes

### Memory Usage
Track memory consumption:
- Per-node memory usage
- Total workflow memory footprint
- Memory leak detection

## Log Aggregation

### Centralized Logging
All workflow logs are aggregated in a single view:
- Filterable by severity (Info, Warning, Error)
- Searchable by keyword
- Exportable for external analysis

<Tip>
  Use structured logging with consistent formats to make log analysis easier.
</Tip>

## Integration with External Tools

### Export Debug Data
Export debug sessions for analysis in external tools:
- JSON format for programmatic access
- CSV format for spreadsheet analysis
- Log files for log aggregation platforms
