# Complex New Addition 2

This is the second brand new file in the comprehensive test.

## Comprehensive Workflow Test

### Expected Behavior

The workflow must correctly:
1. **Categorize** each operation type
2. **Fresh translate** new files (this one + sibling)
3. **Remove** deleted files from cn/jp
4. **Context-aware update** edited files
5. **Rename** files with extension preservation
6. **Move** files using index-based navigation

### Technical Challenges

- No conflicts between operations
- Correct docs.json sync for all languages
- All operation types handled atomically
- Translation quality maintained across operation types

## Validation Matrix

| Operation | File | Expected Result |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| ADD | complex-new-add-1 | Fresh translation |
| ADD | complex-new-add-2 | Fresh translation |
| DELETE | complex-to-delete | Removed cn/jp |
| EDIT | complex-to-edit-1 | Context update |
| EDIT | complex-to-edit-2 | Context update |
| RENAME | complex-renamed | Extension preserved |
| MOVE | complex-to-move | Index-based nav |
