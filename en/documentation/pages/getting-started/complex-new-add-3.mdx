# Complex New Add File 3 (Incremental)

This file is added in the third commit as part of the incremental kitchen sink test.

## Purpose

This file is added alongside multiple other operations:
- **Add**: This file (complex-new-add-3.mdx)
- **Delete**: complex-new-add-1.mdx
- **Rename**: complex-renamed.mdx → complex-renamed-v2.mdx
- **Move**: complex-to-move.mdx to different group
- **Edit**: complex-to-edit-1.mdx and complex-to-edit-2.mdx

All happening in a single incremental commit!

## Incremental Kitchen Sink

This tests the ultimate scenario:
- Workflow handles 6 different operations simultaneously
- Each operation type is validated independently
- Translation updates are applied correctly for each type
- docs.json is synchronized properly across all changes

This is the most comprehensive incremental test possible.
