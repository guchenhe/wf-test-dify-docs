# Renamed File V2 (Updated Again)

This file has been renamed twice:
1. **First rename**: complex-to-rename → complex-renamed (commit 2)
2. **Second rename**: complex-renamed → complex-renamed-v2 (commit 3, this commit)

## Rename in Complex Context

This rename operation happens alongside:
- 2 additions
- 1 deletion
- 2 edits
- 1 move

The workflow must correctly identify this as a rename (not delete+add) and preserve the .mdx extension.

## Incremental Rename (Commit 3)

This incremental commit includes multiple operations:
- **Add**: complex-new-add-3.mdx
- **Delete**: complex-new-add-1.mdx
- **Rename**: This file (complex-renamed → complex-renamed-v2)
- **Move**: complex-to-move.mdx to Debug group
- **Edit**: complex-to-edit-1.mdx and complex-to-edit-2.mdx

All 6 operations in one incremental commit!
