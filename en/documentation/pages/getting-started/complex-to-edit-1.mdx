# Edited File 1 (Updated)

This content has been **significantly updated** as part of the complex mixed operations test.

## Edit Operation

This file demonstrates context-aware translation updates while other operations happen simultaneously:
- Files being added
- Files being deleted
- Files being renamed
- Files being moved

All in one atomic commit!

## Incremental Edit (Commit 3)

This is the second time this file is being edited in separate commits:
- **First edit**: Initial update in commit 2
- **Second edit**: Incremental update in commit 3 (this commit)

Testing incremental context-aware translation across multiple editing rounds while maintaining consistency with previous translations.
