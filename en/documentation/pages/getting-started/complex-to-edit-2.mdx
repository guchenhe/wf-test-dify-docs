# Edited File 2 (Enhanced)

This file has been **comprehensively enhanced** with various content types.

## Rich Content Test

```javascript
// Complex operations in single commit
const operations = {
  adds: ['complex-new-add-1', 'complex-new-add-2'],
  deletes: ['complex-to-delete'],
  edits: ['complex-to-edit-1', 'complex-to-edit-2'],
  renames: {'complex-to-rename': 'complex-renamed'},
  moves: {'complex-to-move': 'Nodes'}
};
```

### Operation Summary

| Type | Count | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| ADD | 2 | ✅ |
| DELETE | 1 | ✅ |
| EDIT | 2 | ✅ |
| RENAME | 1 | ✅ |
| MOVE | 1 | ✅ |

Total: **7 file operations** in one commit!

## Incremental Update (Commit 3)

### Updated Operations Summary

Commit 3 adds even more operations to the test:

| Type | Commit 2 | Commit 3 | Total |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| ADD | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| DELETE | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| EDIT | 2 | 2 (incremental) | 2 |
| RENAME | 1 | 1 (incremental) | 1 |
| MOVE | 1 | 1 (incremental) | 1 |

**Incremental operations in commit 3**: 6 operations (1 add, 1 delete, 2 edits, 1 rename, 1 move)

This demonstrates the workflow's ability to handle complex incremental updates with all operation types mixed together.
