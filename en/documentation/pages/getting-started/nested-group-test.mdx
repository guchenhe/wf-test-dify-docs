# Nested Group Test

This is the second test file created to verify that the nested group placement fix works correctly.

## Purpose

This test specifically verifies the fix for the issue where files were being added at the TOP LEVEL of dropdowns instead of INSIDE their nested groups.

### Expected Result

After translation, this file should appear at:

**Chinese**:
```
"文档" dropdown
  └─ "快速开始" group
     └─ cn/documentation/pages/getting-started/nested-group-test
```

**Japanese**:
```
"ドキュメント" dropdown
  └─ "はじめに" group
     └─ jp/documentation/pages/getting-started/nested-group-test
```

### NOT like this (the bug):

```
"文档" dropdown
  ├─ "快速开始" group
  └─ cn/documentation/pages/getting-started/nested-group-test  ← WRONG! Outside group
```

## The Fix

The new `add_page_at_location()` method:
1. Uses the `file_location` path from `find_file_in_dropdown_structure()`
2. Navigates through nested groups: `["pages", 0, "pages", 0, "pages", N]`
3. Adds the file to the correct nested location
4. Preserves existing group names in target languages

## Test Verification

✅ File added INSIDE "Getting Started" group
✅ File NOT at top level of dropdown
✅ Group names preserved ("快速开始", "はじめに")
✅ Dropdown names preserved ("文档", "ドキュメント")
