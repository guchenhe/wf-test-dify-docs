# Test Edit File 1 (Updated)

This is the **updated version** of the first test file.

## Modified Content

This content has been modified to test context-aware translation updates using git diff.

### New Features

- Context-aware translation using existing translation + git diff
- Terminology consistency across updates
- Efficient incremental translation without full re-translation

### Testing Goals

The workflow should:
1. Detect content changes via git diff
2. Use existing translations as context
3. Apply only necessary translation updates
4. Maintain translation quality and consistency

## Second Incremental Update

This section was added in a third commit to test multiple rounds of incremental translation:
- Tests sequential context-aware updates
- Validates translation consistency across multiple edits
- Ensures existing translations remain stable when adding new content
- Verifies that the workflow can handle continuous documentation improvements
