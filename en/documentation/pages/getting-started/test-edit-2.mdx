# Test Edit File 2 (Enhanced)

This is the **enhanced version** of the second test file with new sections.

## Updated Content

Content modifications include new sections, code examples, and tables.

### Code Example

```javascript
// Example code that should be preserved in translation
function translateContent(source, target) {
  return workflow.translate({
    from: source,
    to: target,
    mode: 'streaming'
  });
}
```

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Translation | Full | Incremental |
| Context | None | Git diff |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |

## Additional Incremental Content

This section demonstrates incremental updates in the second round:
- **Performance**: Each incremental update should be faster than full translation
- **Quality**: Translation quality should remain consistent across updates
- **Context Preservation**: Previous translations provide valuable context

### Real-world Usage

In practice, documentation is frequently updated. The workflow must handle:
1. Typo fixes and clarifications
2. New feature documentation
3. Updated examples and best practices
4. Structural reorganization
