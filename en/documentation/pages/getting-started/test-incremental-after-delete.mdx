# Test Incremental Add After Delete

This file was added in a third commit after the initial delete operations.

## Purpose

This validates that the translation workflow can:
- Handle additions after deletions in the same PR
- Translate new files correctly even after delete operations
- Update docs.json incrementally for all languages
- Maintain proper navigation structure

## Scenario

This tests a realistic workflow where:
1. Initial commit: Delete obsolete files
2. Subsequent commit: Add new replacement files

This is a common pattern when restructuring documentation.
