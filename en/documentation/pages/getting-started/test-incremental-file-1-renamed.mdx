# Incremental Test File 1 (Renamed and Updated)

This file was added in commit 1, updated in commit 2, and now **renamed and updated again in commit 4**.

## Purpose

Tests how the workflow handles progressive changes:
- ✅ Commit 1: Added this file
- ✅ Commit 2: Editing this file + adding another file
- ⏳ Commit 3: Will move a file to different location

Each commit should trigger translation workflow independently.

## Update Details

This edit demonstrates:
- Context-aware translation on previously translated content
- Cumulative changes across commits
- Independent workflow triggers per commit

## Commit 4: Rename + Edit

This fourth commit demonstrates:
- **Rename operation**: File renamed from `test-incremental-file-1.mdx` to `test-incremental-file-1-renamed.mdx`
- **Edit operation**: Content updated with new sections
- **Combined operations**: Both rename and edit in same commit
- **Translation handling**: Workflow should detect rename and apply incremental translation
