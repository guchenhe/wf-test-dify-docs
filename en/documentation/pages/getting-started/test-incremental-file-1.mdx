# Incremental Test File 1 (Updated)

This file was added in commit 1, and now **updated in commit 2**.

## Purpose

Tests how the workflow handles progressive changes:
- ✅ Commit 1: Added this file
- ✅ Commit 2: Editing this file + adding another file
- ⏳ Commit 3: Will move a file to different location

Each commit should trigger translation workflow independently.

## Update Details

This edit demonstrates:
- Context-aware translation on previously translated content
- Cumulative changes across commits
- Independent workflow triggers per commit
