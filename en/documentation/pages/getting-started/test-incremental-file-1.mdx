# Incremental Test File 1

This is the first file added to test incremental changes across multiple commits.

## Purpose

Tests how the workflow handles progressive changes:
- Commit 1: Add this file
- Commit 2: Edit this file + add another
- Commit 3: Move a file to different location

Each commit should trigger translation workflow independently.
