# Incremental Test File 2

This is the second file, added in commit 2 alongside editing file-1.

## Incremental Workflow

This tests:
- Multiple operations in single commit (add + edit)
- Workflow triggered on top of previous commits
- Cumulative translation state management

## Expected Behavior

- File 1: Should receive context-aware update using existing cn/jp translations
- File 2: Should receive fresh translation as new file

## Commit 4 Update

File 2 is also being edited in the fourth commit, alongside File 1's rename:
- Tests incremental edit on already-translated file
- Validates workflow handles mixed operations (rename of File 1 + edit of File 2)
- Confirms context-aware translation continues working across multiple commits

This incremental test now spans **4 commits**, demonstrating robust multi-round translation capabilities.
