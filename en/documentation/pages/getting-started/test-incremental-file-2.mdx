# Incremental Test File 2

This is the second file, added in commit 2 alongside editing file-1.

## Incremental Workflow

This tests:
- Multiple operations in single commit (add + edit)
- Workflow triggered on top of previous commits
- Cumulative translation state management

## Expected Behavior

- File 1: Should receive context-aware update using existing cn/jp translations
- File 2: Should receive fresh translation as new file
