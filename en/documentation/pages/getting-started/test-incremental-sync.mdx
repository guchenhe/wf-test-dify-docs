# Test Incremental Sync

This document is created to test the incremental sync implementation for the auto-translate workflow.

## Purpose

This test verifies that:

1. **Dropdown titles are preserved** - Existing translations like "æ–‡æ¡£" and "ãƒ‰ã‚­ãƒ¥ãƒ¡ãƒ³ãƒˆ" should not be overwritten
2. **Minimal diffs are generated** - Only the new file entries should appear in docs.json, not entire dropdown structures
3. **Automatic translation works** - This file should be automatically translated to Chinese and Japanese

## Expected Behavior

When this PR is created:

- The workflow should detect this new English file
- It should find that it belongs to the "Documentation" dropdown
- It should add corresponding entries to the Chinese and Japanese sections
- The docs.json diff should only show the addition of this file (approximately 4 lines total)

## Test Verification

After the translation PR is created, verify:

- âœ… Chinese section has: `cn/documentation/pages/getting-started/test-incremental-sync.mdx`
- âœ… Japanese section has: `jp/documentation/pages/getting-started/test-incremental-sync.mdx`
- âœ… Chinese dropdown title is still "æ–‡æ¡£" (not "Documentation")
- âœ… Japanese dropdown title is still "ãƒ‰ã‚­ãƒ¥ãƒ¡ãƒ³ãƒˆ" (not "Documentation")
- âœ… No other dropdowns or files were modified in docs.json

## Implementation Details

This test validates the complete solution implemented to fix:

- **Issue #1**: Force-updating dropdown titles
- **Issue #2**: Full sync vs incremental sync

The new `sync_docs_json_incremental()` method should handle this file addition with surgical precision.
