# New Addition 2

This is the second brand new file added in the mixed operations test.

## Complex Scenario

This test validates that the workflow can handle:
1. Multiple operation types in one commit
2. Proper categorization of adds vs deletes vs edits
3. Correct translation and sync for each operation type
4. No conflicts or data loss

### Expected Behavior

- New files: Fresh translation
- Deleted files: Cleanup in all languages
- Edited files: Context-aware incremental updates
