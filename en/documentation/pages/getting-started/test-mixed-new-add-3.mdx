description: Third file added incrementally to test mixed operations workflow

# New File 3 (Incremental Add)

This file is added in a third commit as part of incremental mixed operations testing.

## Purpose

Tests the workflow's ability to handle:
- **Adds**: New files like this one
- **Deletes**: Removing previously added files
- **Edits**: Updating existing files
- All in the same incremental commit!

## Incremental Mixed Operations

This demonstrates a realistic workflow where developers:
1. Remove obsolete or incorrect files (delete previously added file 1)
2. Add new replacement or additional files (this file)
3. Update existing documentation (edit existing files)

All operations combined in a single atomic commit.
