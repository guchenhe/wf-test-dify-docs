# Edited File 1 (Updated)

This content has been **significantly updated** as part of the mixed operations test.

## Updates Made

- Title changed in frontmatter
- Description updated
- Content expanded with new sections
- Added formatting and structure

## Testing Mixed Operations

This file was edited while other files were:
- Being added (new files created)
- Being deleted (old files removed)

All operations happening in the same commit!

## Incremental Update Round 2

This section added in the third commit to test incremental mixed operations:
- **Deleted**: test-mixed-new-add-1.mdx (cleanup)
- **Added**: test-mixed-new-add-3.mdx (replacement)
- **Edited**: This file (incremental update)

### Workflow Benefits

The incremental mixed operations workflow enables:
1. **Atomic changes**: All related changes in one commit
2. **Context-aware translation**: Only affected files are translated
3. **Efficient updates**: No need to wait for full repository translation
4. **Clear history**: Git log shows logical groupings of changes
