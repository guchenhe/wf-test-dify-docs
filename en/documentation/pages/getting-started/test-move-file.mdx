# Move Test File (Moved Again + Edited)

This file has been moved multiple times:
1. **First move**: Getting Started → Nodes (commit 2)
2. **Second move**: Nodes → Build (commit 3, this commit)

Content has been **further updated** in this incremental commit.

## Testing Move + Edit Combo

This tests the workflow's ability to:
- Detect location changes via `group_path` modification in docs.json
- Use index-based navigation to find corresponding cn/jp files
- Apply the same move to all language versions
- Handle content updates simultaneously with structural changes

## Current Location

- **Initial Group**: Getting Started (commit 1)
- **First Move**: Nodes (commit 2)
- **Second Move**: Build ✅ (commit 3, current)
- **Content Status**: Updated again with incremental changes

## Updated Content

### Surgical Reconciliation

The move detection works by:
1. Comparing `group_path` between base commit and HEAD
2. Detecting when a file's location changes (different group path)
3. Using index-based navigation (not group names) to locate cn/jp files
4. Moving files to the new location in all languages

### Index-Based Navigation

Groups are matched by position index, not translated names:
- English: "Nodes" (index 1)
- Chinese: "节点" (index 1) - same position
- Japanese: "ノード" (index 1) - same position

This allows moves to work across translations.

### Content Translation

Content updates are applied via context-aware translation:
```python
def move_and_translate():
    # Move file structurally
    move_file(old_location, new_location)
    # Translate updated content
    translate_with_context(file, existing_translation, git_diff)
```

## Validation

- [ ] File moved in cn/jp docs.json to Nodes group
- [ ] Physical files remain in same directory (only docs.json changes)
- [ ] Updated content translated to cn/jp
- [ ] Index-based navigation worked correctly

## Incremental Move Testing (Commit 3)

This third commit validates incremental move operations:
- **Previous state**: File already moved to Nodes and translated
- **Current operation**: Move again (Nodes → Build) + edit content
- **Expected behavior**:
  - Surgical reconciliation detects second move
  - cn/jp entries moved from Nodes to Build group in docs.json
  - Content changes translated incrementally
  - Index-based navigation finds correct cn/jp locations in Build group

### Why Test Multiple Moves?

Documentation structure often evolves:
- Initial placement (might not fit well)
- First reorganization (better, but not perfect)
- Final optimization (clearest structure)

The workflow must handle each move correctly, regardless of prior history.
