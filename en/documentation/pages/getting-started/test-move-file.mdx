# Move Test File (Moved + Edited)

This file has been **moved from Getting Started to Nodes** and its content has been **updated simultaneously**.

## Testing Move + Edit Combo

This tests the workflow's ability to:
- Detect location changes via `group_path` modification in docs.json
- Use index-based navigation to find corresponding cn/jp files
- Apply the same move to all language versions
- Handle content updates simultaneously with structural changes

## Current Location

- **Previous Group**: Getting Started
- **Current Group**: Nodes ✅
- **Content Status**: Updated with new sections

## Updated Content

### Surgical Reconciliation

The move detection works by:
1. Comparing `group_path` between base commit and HEAD
2. Detecting when a file's location changes (different group path)
3. Using index-based navigation (not group names) to locate cn/jp files
4. Moving files to the new location in all languages

### Index-Based Navigation

Groups are matched by position index, not translated names:
- English: "Nodes" (index 1)
- Chinese: "节点" (index 1) - same position
- Japanese: "ノード" (index 1) - same position

This allows moves to work across translations.

### Content Translation

Content updates are applied via context-aware translation:
```python
def move_and_translate():
    # Move file structurally
    move_file(old_location, new_location)
    # Translate updated content
    translate_with_context(file, existing_translation, git_diff)
```

## Validation

- [ ] File moved in cn/jp docs.json to Nodes group
- [ ] Physical files remain in same directory (only docs.json changes)
- [ ] Updated content translated to cn/jp
- [ ] Index-based navigation worked correctly
