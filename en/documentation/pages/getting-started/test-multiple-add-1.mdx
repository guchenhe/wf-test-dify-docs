# Test Multiple Add File 1

This is the first test file created to validate the translation workflow's ability to handle multiple file additions simultaneously.

## Purpose

This test verifies that the workflow can:
- Detect multiple new files in a single commit
- Translate all files concurrently
- Update docs.json for all languages correctly
- Insert files at the correct index positions

## Content

This file contains sample content that should be translated to Chinese (cn) and Japanese (jp) when pushed to the test branch.

## Incremental Update

This section was added in a second commit to test incremental translation updates. The workflow should:
- Detect this modification
- Use context-aware translation (existing translation + git diff)
- Update only the Chinese and Japanese versions of this file
- Preserve the previously translated content
