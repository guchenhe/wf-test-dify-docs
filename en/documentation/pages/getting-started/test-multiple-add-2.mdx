# Test Multiple Add File 2

This is the second test file created to validate batch translation capabilities.

## Features to Test

- **Concurrent Translation**: Multiple files should be translated in parallel
- **Order Preservation**: Files should maintain their order in docs.json across all languages
- **Terminology Consistency**: Translation terminology should be consistent across all files

## Sample Content

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence contains every letter of the English alphabet and helps test character encoding and translation accuracy.
