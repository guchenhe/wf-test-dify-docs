# Test Multiple Add File 4

This is the fourth test file, added in a second commit to test incremental additions.

## Purpose

This file validates that the translation workflow can:
- Detect new files added after initial PR creation
- Translate new files independently
- Update docs.json incrementally for all languages
- Insert the file at the correct position in the navigation structure

## Incremental Addition

This file was not part of the initial commit. It tests whether the workflow properly handles files added in subsequent commits to the same PR.
