# Rename Test Final (Renamed + Edited)

This file has been **renamed from test-rename-original.mdx to test-rename-final.mdx** and its content has been **significantly updated** in the same commit.

## Testing Rename + Edit Combo

This tests the workflow's ability to:
- Detect file renames (deleted + added in same location)
- Preserve file extensions (.mdx) when renaming cn/jp versions
- Handle content changes simultaneously with rename
- Apply both structural (rename) and content (translation) updates

## Updated Content

### New Sections

This content is entirely new and should be translated to cn/jp along with the rename operation.

### Code Example

```javascript
function testRenameAndEdit() {
  return {
    operation: 'rename',
    oldName: 'test-rename-original',
    newName: 'test-rename-final',
    contentModified: true
  };
}
```

### Important Notes

<Note>
The surgical reconciliation system should:
1. Detect the rename via deletion + addition pattern
2. Rename the corresponding cn/jp files (preserving .mdx extension)
3. Update docs.json entries for all languages
4. Translate the updated content contextually
</Note>

## Validation

- [ ] File renamed in cn/jp directories
- [ ] Extension preserved (.mdx)
- [ ] Content translated with updates
- [ ] docs.json synced correctly
