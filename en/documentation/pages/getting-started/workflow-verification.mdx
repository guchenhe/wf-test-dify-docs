# Workflow Verification Test

This document verifies that the auto-translation workflow functions correctly after the language configuration refactoring.

## What This Tests

After merging the unified configuration refactoring, this PR tests:

### âœ… Config Loading
- Workflow loads `source_language` and `target_languages` from config
- No hardcoded language values are used
- Translation notices come from config

### âœ… Translation Process
- English â†’ Chinese translation executes
- English â†’ Japanese translation executes
- Both use language names from config (`"English"`, `"Chinese"`, `"Japanese"`)

### âœ… File Structure
- Translations created at config-based paths:
  - `cn/documentation/pages/getting-started/workflow-verification.mdx`
  - `jp/documentation/pages/getting-started/workflow-verification.mdx`

### âœ… Translation Notices
- AI notice inserted from `config.json` `translation_notice` field
- Relative path to English version is correct
- Notice format matches config template

### âœ… Navigation Sync
- `docs.json` updated for all language sections
- File appears at same position in all languages
- Navigation structure preserved

## Configuration Verification

The workflow should use these values from `tools/translate/config.json`:

```json
{
  "source_language": "en",
  "target_languages": ["cn", "jp"],
  "languages": {
    "en": {
      "name": "English",
      "directory": "en"
    },
    "cn": {
      "name": "Chinese",
      "directory": "cn",
      "translation_notice": "<Note>...</Note>"
    },
    "jp": {
      "name": "Japanese",
      "directory": "jp",
      "translation_notice": "<Note>...</Note>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Translation PR created automatically
âœ… Chinese file exists with correct notice
âœ… Japanese file exists with correct notice
âœ… docs.json synced for all languages
âœ… No hardcoded language errors in logs
âœ… Workflow completes without config errors

If all criteria pass, the refactoring is successful! ðŸŽ‰
