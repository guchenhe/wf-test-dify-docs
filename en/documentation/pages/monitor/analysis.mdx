The dashboard tracks four metrics over time to show how your application performs:

  alt="monitoring-dashboard.png"
  title="monitoring-dashboard.png"
  className="mt-1"
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

**Total Messages:** Conversation volume  
**Active Users:** Users with meaningful interactions (more than one exchange)  
**Average User Interactions:** Engagement depth per session  
**Token Usage:** Resource consumption and costs

Use the time selector to view trends over different periods. Click **"Tracing app performance"** to connect external observability platforms like Langfuse or LangSmith for deeper analytics.
