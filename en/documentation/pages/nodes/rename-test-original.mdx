# Rename Detection Test

This file tests the rename detection fix in the auto-translation workflow.

## Test Plan

**Step 1 (this PR):** Add this file as `rename-test-original.mdx`
- Gets translated to cn/jp
- Merged to main

**Step 2 (next PR):** Rename to `rename-test-final.mdx` with identical content
- Git detects R100 (100% match)
- Workflow renames cn/jp files
- No re-translation

## Expected Results After Step 2

- Physical files renamed in cn/jp with `.mdx` extension preserved
- Docs.json updated in all language sections
- Existing translations preserved (not re-translated)
