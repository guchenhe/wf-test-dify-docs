This is a test node created to validate the automatic translation workflow's ability to handle newly added files.

## Purpose

The Test Add Node demonstrates:

- Fresh file translation from English to Chinese and Japanese
- Proper docs.json synchronization across language sections
- Correct placement in navigation structure using index-based positioning

## Test Validation

When this file is added to the repository:

1. The translation workflow should detect this new file in the English section
2. Generate fresh translations for Chinese (cn) and Japanese (jp) versions
3. Insert entries in docs.json for both target languages at the same index position
4. Add translation notices to the beginning of translated files

## Expected Behavior

**Translation Mode**: Fresh translation (no git diff context needed)

**Processing Time**: ~30-60 seconds per target language

**Output Files**:
- `cn/documentation/pages/nodes/test-add-node.mdx`
- `jp/documentation/pages/nodes/test-add-node.mdx`

## Success Criteria

- Both translated files contain proper frontmatter with translated title and description
- Translation notices appear at the beginning of each file
- Navigation structure maintains consistent group indices across all language sections
- Terminology from termbase_i18n.md is correctly applied

## Incremental Update Test

This section was added in a second commit to test incremental translation on the same branch.

**Testing**: When the workflow processes this update, it should:

- Detect the content change via git diff
- Use context-aware translation with existing translation + new content
- Preserve translation notices
- Maintain consistent terminology
