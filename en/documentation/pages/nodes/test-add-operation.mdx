# Test Add Operation

This test validates that the ADD operation works correctly after implementing the three rename fixes.

## Purpose

Ensure that adding new files:
- ✅ Creates cn/jp translations
- ✅ Adds entries to docs.json for all languages
- ✅ Entries have no file extensions
- ✅ Physical files are created correctly

## Expected Results

After auto-sync:
- `cn/documentation/pages/nodes/test-add-operation.mdx` created
- `jp/documentation/pages/nodes/test-add-operation.mdx` created
- docs.json entries: `cn/.../test-add-operation` (no extension)
- docs.json entries: `jp/.../test-add-operation` (no extension)
