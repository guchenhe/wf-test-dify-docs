This is a second test file added to the test/add-single branch to validate incremental operations.

## Purpose

This file demonstrates:

- Multiple add operations on the same branch
- Batch processing of mixed operations (fresh + incremental)
- Workflow handling of cumulative changes
- Translation consistency across multiple commits

## Test Scenario

The test/add-single branch now contains:

1. **First commit**: Added test-add-node.mdx (already translated)
2. **Second commit**: Add this file + update test-add-node.mdx

This validates that the workflow can handle both fresh translation of new files and incremental updates of existing files in a single workflow run.
