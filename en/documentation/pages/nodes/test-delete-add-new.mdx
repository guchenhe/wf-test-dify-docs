This file is added on the test/delete-single branch after a deletion, testing mixed operations.

## Purpose

Validates:

- Delete operation followed by add operation on same branch
- Mixed operation processing in single workflow run
- Proper cleanup of deleted files + fresh translation of new files

## Test Flow

1. **First commit**: Created temp file
2. **Second commit**: Deleted temp file
3. **Third commit**: Add this new file

This ensures the workflow handles cumulative changes correctly.
