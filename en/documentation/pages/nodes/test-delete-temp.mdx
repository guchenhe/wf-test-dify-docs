This is a temporary test file that will be deleted in the next commit to validate the deletion workflow.

## Purpose

This file exists solely to be deleted, allowing us to test:

- Deletion detection in the translation workflow
- Removal of corresponding cn/jp files
- Docs.json cleanup across language sections
- Physical file deletion propagation

## Expected Behavior

When this file is deleted:

1. The workflow detects the deletion from git diff
2. Removes corresponding cn/jp translated files
3. Removes entries from docs.json in all language sections
4. Logs successful deletion operations

This file should not persist beyond the initial commit.
