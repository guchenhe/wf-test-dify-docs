# Test Duplicate Fix

This is a test file created to validate the fix for duplicate auto-sync commits in the translation workflow.

## Purpose

When this PR is created and pushed:
1. The analyze workflow should run successfully
2. The execute workflow should create the initial translation PR
3. When a second commit is pushed, only the update workflow should run
4. There should be NO duplicate commits on the translation PR

## Expected Behavior

- First push: Execute workflow creates translation PR
- Second push: Only update workflow runs (execute workflow skips)
- Result: No duplicate commits

## Test Date

2025-11-12
