This file is added on the test/rename-single branch alongside rename and update operations.

## Purpose

Validates the complete set of operations on a single branch:

- **Rename**: test-rename-updated → test-rename-final
- **Add**: This new file
- **Update**: Modify test-rename-final content

## Comprehensive Testing

This combination ensures the workflow can handle:

- Multiple rename operations (first + second rename)
- Fresh translation of new files
- Incremental updates of renamed files
- Mixed structural + content changes
- All operation types in single workflow run
