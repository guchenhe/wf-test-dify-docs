# Test Rename Fix - Step 1

This is the initial version of the test file.

Expected workflow behavior:
1. This file gets added and translated to cn/jp
2. In next commit, file will be renamed to step2
3. Workflow should correctly rename both physical files AND docs.json entries

## Test Details

- PR: #189
- Issue: docs.json entries not updated during rename
- Fix: Updated `_handle_rename` to update docs.json entries
