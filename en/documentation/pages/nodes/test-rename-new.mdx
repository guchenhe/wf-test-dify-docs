This file tests the rename operation fix.

## Test Objective

Verify that when this file is renamed to `test-rename-new.mdx`:

1. **Physical files** are renamed in cn/jp
2. **docs.json entries** are updated in cn/jp
3. **File names match** across all languages

## Previous Bug

Rename operations were detected but NOT applied to translations:
- cn/jp files kept old names
- docs.json entries kept old names
- Caused file reference mismatches

## Expected After Fix

When renamed `old → new`:
- ✅ cn file renamed: `test-rename-old.mdx` → `test-rename-new.mdx`
- ✅ jp file renamed: `test-rename-old.mdx` → `test-rename-new.mdx`
- ✅ docs.json updated in all language sections
