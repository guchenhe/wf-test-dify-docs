This file will be renamed to validate the rename detection workflow.

## Purpose

This test validates:

- Rename detection (delete + add in same location)
- Physical file renaming with extension preservation
- Docs.json updates across language sections
- Index-based location tracking

## Expected Behavior

When this file is renamed:

1. Workflow detects deletion + addition at same index position
2. Recognizes the operation as a rename (not separate delete/add)
3. Renames physical files in cn/jp with correct extension
4. Updates docs.json entries in all language sections
5. Preserves existing translations (no re-translation)

## File Extension Handling

The rename operation must:

- Detect the file extension (.mdx) from physical file
- Preserve extension when renaming cn/jp files
- Update docs.json entries (stored without extensions)
