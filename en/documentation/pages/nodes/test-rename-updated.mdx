# Rename Test - Original Version

This file tests incremental rename detection across multiple commits in a single PR.

## Test Sequence

**Commit 1:** Create this file (test-rename-original.mdx)
- Workflow translates to cn/jp
- Sets baseline for rename detection

**Commit 2:** Rename to test-rename-updated.mdx
- Workflow should detect R100 rename
- Should rename cn/jp physical files
- Should update docs.json entries
- Should NOT re-translate

**Commit 3:** Multiple operations
- Rename test-rename-updated → test-rename-final
- Add test-rename-addnew.mdx (fresh translation)
- Modify test-rename-final.mdx (incremental update)

This validates the complete rename detection fix.
