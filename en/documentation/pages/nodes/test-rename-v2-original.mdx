# Rename Detection Test v2

This file will be renamed to validate the rename detection fix.

## Test Scenario

1. Create this file with original name
2. Rename to new name (content unchanged)
3. Verify cn/jp files are renamed correctly
4. Verify docs.json is updated across all languages

## Expected Behavior

- Physical files renamed: `cn/*/test-rename-v2-original.mdx` → `cn/*/test-rename-v2-updated.mdx`
- Physical files renamed: `jp/*/test-rename-v2-original.mdx` → `jp/*/test-rename-v2-updated.mdx`
- Docs.json entries updated in all language sections
- No re-translation (existing translation preserved)
- Extension preserved (.mdx stays .mdx)
