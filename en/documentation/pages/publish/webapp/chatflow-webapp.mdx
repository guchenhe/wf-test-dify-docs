Chat web apps transform your chatflow into a complete conversation experience. Users get persistent chat sessions, smart interactions, and all the features you've configured—without installing anything.

## How Chat Apps Work

Your chatflow automatically becomes a web app when you publish it. The system creates a responsive interface that:

- **Maintains conversation context** across user sessions
- **Inherits all orchestration settings** from your chatflow configuration
- **Adapts to any screen size** from mobile to desktop
- **Handles user authentication** if you've enabled access controls

<Tip>
Unlike single-use text generators, chat apps maintain conversation memory and let users build on previous exchanges.
</Tip>

## Interactive Features

Your web app automatically includes these capabilities based on your chatflow settings:

</CardGroup>

## Pre-conversation Setup

When your chatflow uses variables, users complete a form before chatting starts. This front-loads context gathering instead of interrupting the conversation flow.

</Frame>

Here's how the user experience works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User lands on your app">
    They see a clean form requesting necessary context information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Form completion unlocks chat">
    The "Start Conversation" button activates only after required fields are filled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI has full context">
    The conversation begins with all the background information it needs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Every form field adds friction. Only ask for information that meaningfully improves responses.
</Warning>

## Conversation Experience

Once chatting begins, users get an interface designed for natural interaction:

</Frame>

Every AI response includes these actions:

- **Copy button** - One-click copying for easy sharing or note-taking
- **Feedback buttons** - Like/dislike ratings to improve your app over time  
- **Follow-up suggestions** - AI generates 3 contextually relevant next questions

## Session Management

Users can manage multiple conversation threads like modern messaging apps:

</Frame>

**Conversation Controls:**
- **Start new** - Begin fresh conversations without losing context from previous ones
- **Pin important** - Keep crucial conversations accessible at the top of the list  
- **Delete finished** - Clean up conversations that are no longer relevant

<Info>
Each conversation thread maintains its own memory and context. Users can seamlessly switch between different topics or projects.
</Info>

## Conversation Openers

Enable conversation openers to eliminate the intimidating blank chat screen:

</Frame>

When users start new conversations, the AI proactively introduces itself and explains its capabilities. This immediately shows users what they can accomplish and increases engagement.

<Tip>
Conversation openers work especially well for specialized apps where users might not know all available features.
</Tip>

## Follow-up Questions

The system automatically generates contextual follow-up questions after each AI response:

<Frame>

</Frame>

These suggestions are:
- **Contextually relevant** to the current conversation topic
- **Dynamically generated** based on the AI's response  
- **Clickable shortcuts** that help users explore deeper or pivot to related topics

## Voice Input

Speech-to-text transforms your chat app into a voice-first experience:

</Frame>

**How it works:**
1. The microphone button appears when you enable speech-to-text in your chatflow
2. Users click to start recording their question
3. Speech converts to text in real-time as they speak
4. They can edit the text before sending or send immediately

<Warning>
Users must grant microphone permissions in their browser. The app will prompt for this permission when they first try to use voice input.
</Warning>

## Source Citations

When your app references knowledge bases or external content, citations show users exactly where information comes from:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable citations">
    In your workspace, go to **Add Function → Citation and Attribution**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure sources">
    Choose which knowledge bases should show citations when referenced.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic display">
    Citations appear automatically with relevant AI responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Citations build user trust by providing transparency about information sources. Users can click through to verify details or explore source materials further.
