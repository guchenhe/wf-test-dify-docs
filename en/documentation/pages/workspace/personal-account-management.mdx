Your personal account spans all workspaces you belong to. Profile settings, language preferences, and login credentials follow you everywhere, while each workspace maintains its own team dynamics and permissions.

## Account Setup

**Dify Cloud** creates your account automatically on first login. You can use GitHub, Google, or email verification. Accounts with matching email addresses are automatically linked.

**Community Edition** requires email and password setup during installation. The administrator account is configured when the system is first deployed.

## Multi-Workspace Access

Your personal account can belong to multiple workspaces. Each workspace has its own team, applications, and billing, but your profile remains consistent across all of them.

**Switching Workspaces:** Use the workspace selector in the top-left corner to switch between workspaces you have access to.

**Workspace Independence:** Your role and permissions are set per-workspace. You might be an Owner in one workspace and a Member in another.

## Profile Management

Update your profile information in Settings → Account → Profile. Changes apply across all workspaces you belong to.

**Profile Picture:** Upload a custom avatar. This replaces the default initials-based avatar and appears in all workspaces.

**Display Name:** How you appear to team members across all workspaces. Choose something that helps teammates identify you.

**Email Address:** Your primary login credential and unique identifier. Changing your email affects all workspaces using the old address.

## Language and Interface

**Display Language:** Available languages include English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. This setting affects interface elements but not your application content.

**Change Language:** Click your avatar → Language, then select your preferred language.

## Login Methods by Edition

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Edition</th>
      <th>Login Methods</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Community</td>
      <td>Email and password only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloud</td>
      <td>GitHub, Google, Email with verification code</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Account Linking:** Dify Cloud automatically links accounts with the same email address. If you sign up with GitHub using email@company.com, then later use email verification with the same address, the system recognizes them as the same account.

## Security

**Cloud Users:** Leverage social login (GitHub/Google) for enhanced security. Review your chosen provider's security settings and monitor login activity through their platform.

**Community Edition Users:** Use strong, unique passwords and change them regularly. Don't share login credentials with others.

**Cross-Workspace:** Your personal settings follow you everywhere, but remember that each workspace has its own security model and permissions.

<Warning>
Changing your email address affects all workspaces. If you want to change the email for just one workspace, consider having that workspace invite the new email as a separate user account.
</Warning>
