## Dify for Education

Current students and teachers can use Dify's Professional plan for free through Dify for Education.

### Getting the Education Discount

**Prerequisites:**
- Be 18 or older
- Current student, teacher, or educational staff member
- Valid educational email address ending in `.edu`

**Steps:**

1. **Create account** - Register at [cloud.dify.ai](https://cloud.dify.ai/signin) with your educational email

2. **Apply for verification** - Go to Settings → Billing → Get Education Verified. Enter your school's full name and select your role.

3. **Activate subscription** - After approval, upgrade to Professional plan with annual billing. The education coupon applies automatically, making it free.

Your subscription will show as `Pro(Edu)` once activated. Renewal is required annually.

### Education FAQ

**What if I already have a paid subscription?**
The education coupon cannot be applied to paid subscriptions at this time. We suggest you activate the free Professional plan after your current billing cycle ends.

**Why was my verification rejected?**
Common reasons: non-educational email, fraudulent information, or misuse of privileges. Appeal via support@dify.ai.

**Can I use a personal email?**
No, institutional email required for verification.
