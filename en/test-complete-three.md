# Complete Flow Test - File Three

This third file completes the end-to-end validation.

## Expected Behavior

**Update Workflow (Final Test):**
- Smart merge preserves ALL previous entries
- docs.json should have:
  - cn/test-complete-one (preserved from commit 1)
  - cn/test-complete-two (preserved from commit 2)
  - cn/test-complete-three (added in this commit)

**Success Criteria:**
✅ ALL THREE files preserved in cn/jp navigation
✅ Complete workflow validated end-to-end
