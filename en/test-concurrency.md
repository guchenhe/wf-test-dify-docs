# Concurrency Test

This file is used to test the concurrency control in translation workflows.

## Version 3

Updated content - commit 3. Third rapid update in succession.

With concurrency groups, this workflow should queue behind commit 2's workflow.
All three workflows should run sequentially, not concurrently.
