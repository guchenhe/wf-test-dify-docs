# Test Sync Mixed MDX

This is a test document in MDX format to validate mixed file type synchronization.

## Purpose

This test validates:
- MDX files with components are translated correctly
- Mixed changes (MDX + docs.json) are synced together
- Component syntax is preserved in translations

<Callout type="info">
This is a callout component that should be preserved during translation.
</Callout>

## MDX Features

### Code Blocks
```javascript
// JavaScript code example
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet('World'));
```

### Lists with MDX
- Standard markdown list item
- Another item with **bold** and *italic*
- Item with [link](https://example.com)

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Components like this should maintain their structure across all language versions.
</Callout>

## Test Verification

This file should be:
1. Synced to `cn/test-sync-mixed-mdx.mdx`
2. Synced to `jp/test-sync-mixed-mdx.mdx`
3. Added to docs.json navigation in all language sections
4. Translated while preserving MDX component syntax
