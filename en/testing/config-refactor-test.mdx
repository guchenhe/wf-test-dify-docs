# Config Refactor Test

This is a test document created to verify that the language configuration refactoring works correctly.

## Purpose

The refactoring unified all language configuration into a single source of truth at `tools/translate/config.json`. This test verifies:

1. **Auto-translation triggers correctly** - The workflow should detect this new English file
2. **Config-based language loading** - Languages are loaded from config, not hardcoded
3. **Translation to all target languages** - Should create `cn/testing/config-refactor-test.mdx` and `jp/testing/config-refactor-test.mdx`
4. **Translation notices** - Each translated file should have the correct AI notice from config
5. **docs.json sync** - Navigation should be updated for all languages

## Expected Results

After this PR is merged:
- Chinese translation should appear in `cn/testing/config-refactor-test.mdx`
- Japanese translation should appear in `jp/testing/config-refactor-test.mdx`
- Both translations should have AI notices with correct relative links
- `docs.json` should include this file in all three language sections

## Configuration Details

The new unified configuration allows adding new languages by simply editing `config.json`:

```json
{
  "source_language": "en",
  "target_languages": ["cn", "jp"],
  "languages": {
    "en": {
      "code": "en",
      "name": "English",
      "directory": "en"
    },
    "cn": {
      "code": "cn",
      "name": "Chinese",
      "directory": "cn",
      "translation_notice": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

No code changes required to add a new language!
