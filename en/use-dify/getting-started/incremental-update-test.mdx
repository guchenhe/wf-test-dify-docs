# Incremental Update Test

This file was added as a **second commit** to test the incremental update workflow.

## Purpose

This tests that when you push additional commits to a PR that already has a translation PR:

1. **Update Translation PR** workflow triggers (not Execute)
2. System detects **last processed commit** from translation branch
3. Calculates incremental range: `last_processed..new_head`
4. Translates only **changed/added files** since last sync
5. Updates translation PR with new commit

## Workflow Behavior

### First Commit (Already Processed)
- Added: `workflow-validation.mdx`
- Modified: `quick-start.mdx`
- Moved: `key-concepts`
- Result: Translation PR #252 created

### Second Commit (This File)
- Added: `incremental-update-test.mdx`
- Should trigger: **Update Translation PR** workflow
- Should update: PR #252 with new translations

## Validation Points

✅ Incremental update workflow triggers
✅ Detects last processed commit correctly
✅ Translates only new/changed files
✅ Updates existing translation PR (doesn't create new one)
✅ Adds commit to translation branch
✅ Comments on both PRs about update
