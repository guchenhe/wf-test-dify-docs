# Test New Feature

This is a test document to validate the automated translation workflow after refactoring language codes from `cn`/`jp` to `zh`/`ja`.

## Purpose

This document tests:

- **Add operation**: New file creation and translation
- **docs.json sync**: Automatic insertion at correct index position
- **Multi-language handling**: Translation to both Chinese and Japanese
- **Config-driven approach**: All language references from `config.json`

## Content

This feature demonstrates the power of Dify's automated documentation translation system.

### Key Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All translations use the same terminology database
2. **Efficiency**: Automatic translation reduces manual work
3. **Accuracy**: AI-powered translation with context awareness

### Technical Details

The translation system:
- Uses Dify API streaming mode for reliability
- Applies surgical reconciliation for structural changes
- Validates file paths for security
- Tracks incremental changes for efficiency

## Conclusion

This test validates that the refactored translation system works correctly with the new language codes.
