Dify is an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) application development platform. It combines Backend as Service and LLMOps concepts, enabling developers to rapidly build production-ready generative AI applications. Even non-technical users can participate in defining AI applications and managing operational data.

The platform includes essential technology stacks for building LLM applications, including support for hundreds of models, an intuitive Prompt orchestration interface, a high-quality RAG engine, a robust Agent framework, flexible process orchestration, and provides both a user-friendly interface and APIs. This saves developers from reinventing the wheel, allowing them to focus on innovation and business requirements.

## What Can Dify Do?

The word Dify comes from Define + Modify, meaning to define and continuously improve your AI applications - it's done for you (Do it for you).
- Integrate LLM into existing business applications, enhance current applications by introducing LLM capabilities, connect to Dify's RESTful API to decouple Prompts from business code, and track data, costs, and usage in Dify's management interface to continuously improve application performance.
- Serve as enterprise-level LLM infrastructure - banks and large internet companies are deploying Dify as their enterprise LLM gateway to accelerate GenAI technology adoption within their organizations while maintaining centralized oversight.
- Explore LLM capabilities - even if you're a technology enthusiast, Dify makes it easy to practice Prompt engineering and Agent technology. Before GPTs were introduced, over 60,000 developers had already created their first applications on Dify.
